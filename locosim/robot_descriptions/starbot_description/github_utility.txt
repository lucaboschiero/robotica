The purpose of this file is to help other students like us to use github. 
In particular here belows are written some important commands to run and some possibile error you may enconter.

UPDATE YOUR REMOTE
git pull remote_origin_branch branch
ex. git pull origin starbot
update the embedded repositories of the main repo -> git submodule update or git submodule update --init --recursive

COMMIT CHANGES ON SERVER
controll the status of the remote respect to the server -> git status
if there are any untracked file -> git add file/path 
modified file will be commited without add using the following commands
then commit changes with a comment -> git commit -m "words"
to commit all changes in one round -> git commit -a -> wrote some words and press ctrlX then Y then push Invio 
keep track of whitch branch are you in -> git branch
change branch if needed -> git checkout branch_name
finally push the changes -> git push remote_origin_branch branch
ex. git push origin starbot

AUTHENTICATION FAILED
usually this happens when we want to push via ssh the changes but the origin of your repository is set to https
control the remote with -> git remote -v 
then if the url start with https copy it and paste on this command here -> git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git

DELETE FOLDER ON REMOTE REPO
rm -rf path/folder
then you can re-clone it again with -> git clone 'url_path'

HEAD DETACHED
if you have changes that want to be commited then generate a temporary branch where to save them
commit -> git commit -a / git -m commit "..."
check the branch -> git branch -> if head detached then follow these instructions
create a temporary branch -> git branch tmp 
go to the branch where you want to commit them -> git checkout name_branch
commit the changes by -> git merge tmp
delete the temporary branch -> git branch -d tmp
or you can create a new branch without running the commands above -> git checkout -b new_local_branchname
git push origin branch_name
